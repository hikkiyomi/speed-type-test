![Preview](preview.png "Preview")

## Installation

- Download Go language.

    For Arch-based distros use pacman: `sudo pacman -S go`
    For Red Hat-based distros use dnf: `sudo dnf install golang`

- Download any collection of words (or create it by yourself!).

    You may use package managers for that as well.

    For Arch-based distros: `sudo pacman -S words`
    For Red Hat-based distros: `sudo yum install words`
    For Debian and Ubuntu-based distros: `sudo apt-get install wamerican` OR `sudo apt-get install wbritish`

    These collections will be located at `/usr/share/dict` directory.

    To create a collection of words by yourself, simply put your desirable words into some file so there is only one word in each line.
    The example of manually created collection of words is the file "word_collection" in this repository.

- Clone this repository into one of your directories.

- Make sure that you have the non-empty env variable GOBIN.
If not, set it to whatever path you want (e.g. `$HOME/go/bin/`) and put $GOBIN into $PATH.
Also make sure that directory $GOBIN exists.

- Run `go build -o stt . && mv stt $GOBIN` from the directory where this repository is located.

## Usage

Run `stt --help` in your terminal to get more information.

The application supports following flags:
- `-t, --timeout int`. Default is 30. Specifies the timeout for timer. If set to 0, the time is unlimited and timer is replaced with stopwatch.
- `-w, --wrap int`. Default is 10. Specifies the amount of words in one line.
- `-i, --input string`. Default is `/usr/share/dict/american-english`. Specifies the word collection.

If you have created your own word collection, just put the path to it into the -i (--input) flag.
